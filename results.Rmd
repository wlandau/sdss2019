This report does not contain the full workflow end-to-end. Instead, it is a small piece of the overall deep learning workflow. `drake`'s philosophy is to have R Markdown reports do as little computation as possible.

```{r}
library(drake)
readd(history_plot)
```

And here is the confusion matrix.

```{r}
loadd(conf_matrix)
conf_matrix
```
